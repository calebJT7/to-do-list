# Productivity Dashboard & Task Manager

A comprehensive frontend productivity web application built to practice DOM manipulation, UI state management, and complex logic using Vanilla JavaScript (approx. 500 lines of code). 

## Live Demo
[View the project online](https://calebjt7.github.io/to-do-list/)

## Features
* Interactive dashboard with real-time clock and weather integration.
* Task management system (tracking completed and pending tasks).
* Notes module for quick text storage.
* Integrated Pomodoro timer for focus sessions.
* Calendar view.
* Simulated user authentication UI (Login/Logout flow).

## Technologies Used
* HTML5
* CSS3
* Vanilla JavaScript

## Known Issues (Pending Refactor)
* **Session State Bug:** The login/registration flow currently experiences a state management issue. Upon logging in, a manual page refresh (F5) is sometimes required to correctly bypass the login screen and render the dashboard view. 

## Note
This project was developed strictly as a frontend educational experience to improve JavaScript logic skills, operating entirely on the client side without backend database persistence.
